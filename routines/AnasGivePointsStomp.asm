; this is an adaptation of $01AB46 from Kevin's koopa disassembly: https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=23125
; unlike other point-giving routines, this one automatically takes Koopster's 'no consecutive scoring' patch into account!
; https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=40262
;
; this means that with that patch applied, you won't inappropriately rack up points when stomping on the sprite,
; and instead you'll constantly get whatever score is specified from there for normal stomps
